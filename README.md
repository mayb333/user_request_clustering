# User Request Clustering
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the clustering of user requests using NLP techniques. The primary focus is to categorize user inquiries, typically directed to a chatbot, into distinct clusters for better understanding and analysis. This approach is particularly useful in enhancing the efficiency of customer support systems by identifying common patterns and themes in user communications.
